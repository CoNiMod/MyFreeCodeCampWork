# Personal Library - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack JavaScript application for managing a personal library, built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Quality Assurance certification. The application provides a RESTful API for managing books and comments.

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Add books to library with title validation
- ✅ Retrieve all books with comment counts
- ✅ Get individual book details with comments
- ✅ Add comments to existing books
- ✅ Delete individual books
- ✅ Clear entire library

### API Endpoints
1. **POST /api/books** - Add a new book
2. **GET /api/books** - Get all books
3. **GET /api/books/{_id}** - Get specific book
4. **POST /api/books/{_id}** - Add comment to book
5. **DELETE /api/books/{_id}** - Delete specific book
6. **DELETE /api/books** - Delete all books

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Testing**: Mocha test framework with Chai assertions
- **Middleware**: CORS, Body Parser
- **Environment**: Configurable via .env file

## Test Coverage
- **15 functional tests** covering all API endpoints
- **Model validation tests** for Book schema
- **Error handling tests** for missing required fields
- **Edge case tests** for special characters and data types
